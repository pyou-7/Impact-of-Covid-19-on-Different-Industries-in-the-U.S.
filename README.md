# COVID-19 Impact Analysis on Different Industries Project

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Collection and Analysis Project repository! This repository contains two main Jupyter notebooks where I have collected and analyzed data related to COVID-19.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection

**Notebook**: [Final_Project_Data_Collection.ipynb](https://github.com/pyou-7/Impact-of-Covid-19-on-Different-Industries-in-the-U.S./blob/main/Final_Project_Data_Collection.ipynb)

**Description**: In this notebook, I utilized various data sources to collect comprehensive datasets related to COVID-19. The key steps included:
- Accessing public APIs to gather up-to-date COVID-19 data.
- Preprocessing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Storing the collected data in a structured format for further analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis

**Notebook**: [Final_Project_Data_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/pyou-7/Impact-of-Covid-19-on-Different-Industries-in-the-U.S./blob/main/Final_Project_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

**Description**: In this notebook, I performed detailed analysis on the collected COVID-19 data. The key steps included:
- Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends.
- Visualizing the data using various plotting libraries to effectively communicate findings.
- Performing statistical analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 across different regions.
